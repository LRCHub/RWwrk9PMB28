[00:24.82] What's that in the corner?
[00:30.48] It's too dark to see
[00:35.75] What's that noise I'm hearing
[00:41.22] Who's that calling me?
[00:52.22] 
[00:44.31] Long ago and far away I heard your voice
[00:49.62] But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
[00:55.29] Terror took control it told me what to say
[01:00.77] And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way
[01:24.77] 
[01:05.45] After dark, I see you
[01:09.64] After dark, I feel you
[01:13.71] After dark, I want you
[01:17.85] After dark, I need you
[01:28.85] 
[01:27.60] Of age there is no question
[01:32.98] Death's shadow is undone
[01:38.56] We only need each other
[01:43.98] In shelter from the sun
[01:55.48] 
[01:47.44] Long ago and far away I heard your voice
[01:52.78] But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
[01:58.22] Terror took control it told me what to say
[02:03.45] And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way
[02:27.45] 
[02:08.36] After dark, I need you
[02:12.61] After dark, I want you
[02:16.65] After dark, I feel you
[02:20.85] After dark, I see you
[02:31.35] 
[02:55.33] There's no turning back now
[03:00.58] My fate is traced in blood
[03:05.94] I've tasted true salvation
[03:11.49] Your power is my drug
[03:21.99] 
[03:14.92] Long ago and far away I heard your voice
[03:20.34] But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
[03:25.98] Terror took control it told me what to say
[03:31.35] And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way
[03:55.35] 
[03:36.03] After dark, I need you
[03:40.23] After dark, I want you
[03:44.28] After dark, I feel you
[03:48.45] After dark, I see you
[03:52.45] After dark, I touch you
[03:56.77] After dark, I do!
[04:00.82] After dark
[04:02.21] After dark
[04:03.71] After dark

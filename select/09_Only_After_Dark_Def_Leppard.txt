Ahh
I feel my spirit fly, only after dark
Ahh
I kiss the world good-bye, only after dark
Night,
With the city lights, only after dark
Run
Like a runaway, only after dark

Won't you disappear
Into midnight again

(Why don't you come
Why won't you come
Why don't you fly fly fly with me)

Sweet innocent fate will be our company
(Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh)

We
At the plant remain, only after dark
Moon,
Simple as can be, only after dark

Oh, yeah!

It's wrong
To feel so free, only after dark
Only you
Do it to me, only after dark

Won't you disappear
Into midnight again

(Why don't you come
Why won't you come
Why don't you fly fly fly with me)

Sweet innocent fate will be our company
(Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh)

We've never had a heart to heart,
But you still call me up after dark, the dark (x3)

(REPEAT)

Hands in the air like the waves of the sea,
Walls drip with sweat and we move to the beat,
You got the list of the drinks are on me,
There's a queue for the ladies the men's round the street,
I'm in your pocket with coins and the keys,
While you're in the crowd cus you so love to tease,
Round about midnight pretend i'm not here,
Come to AM and you wisper in my ear,

We've never had a heart to heart,
But you still call me up after dark, the dark (x3)

The music is loud and time travels fast,
Things that feel good are things that don't last,
While you go off looking for friends in the dark,
I tried to hold onto my drink and my heart,
I'm in your pocket with coins and the keys,
While you're in the crowd cus you so love to tease,
Round about midnight pretend i'm not here,
Come to AM and you wisper in my ear,

We've never had a heart to heart,
But you still call me up after dark, the dark (x3)

We never had a heart to heart,
But you still seek me out after dark,
Now you've taught me tooth and claw,
But you've still got me coming back for more

(INSTRUMENTAL: APPROX 7 SECS)

We've never had a heart to heart,
But you still call me up after dark, the dark (x3)

I've never seen you in the light of day,
But tonight you're coming out to play (x4)

We've never had a heart to heart,
But you still call me up after dark, the dark (x3)

Ohh yeah,
Ahh ohh yeah,
Ahh ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

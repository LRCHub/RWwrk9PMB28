I feel my spirit fly
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ha)
I kiss the world goodbye
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
Nights with the city lights
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
Run let them wonder way
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)

Won't you disappear
Into midnight with me
(Why don't you come,
Why won't you come
Why won't you fly, fly, fly with me)

Sweet elusive fate will be our company
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah...)
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)

Bring out the vamp in me
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
Moon sinful as can be
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
It's wrong to feel so free
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
Only you do it to me
Only after dark (Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)

Won't you disappear
Into midnight with me
(Why don't you come,
Why won't you come
Why won't you fly, fly, fly with me)

Sweet elusive fate will be our company
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah...)
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah. Ah ah ah ah)

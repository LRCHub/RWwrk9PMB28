I'm looking at the sky, I'm trying
Not to cry, coz' it's over
The're turning down the light
It's late now
I guess it's time to say
Goodbye...

Coz it's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed
We've been served
Icecold beer
And Waldy is our host

It's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed...
The party is over
The night is here
Let's bring out a toast...

Well its the end of the show
It's time to go
Along the cliffs at night
Were taking you home

Hey take a look at the park
What a beautifull sight

It's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed
We've been served
Icecold beer
And Waldy is our host

It's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed...
The party is over
The night is here
Let's bring out a toast...

It's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed
We've been served
Icecold beer
And Waldy is our host

It's after dark now
And Disneyland is closed...
The party is over
The night is here
Let's bring out a toast...

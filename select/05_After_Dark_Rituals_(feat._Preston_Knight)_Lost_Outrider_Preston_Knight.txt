I've met nobody with a body like Nakita
In a candle soft light she's more than I deserve
A work of art
An innocence
Came to life for me from ten to ten
She clothed the floor and pulled me in
Leading me softly to an evening

Of after dark rituals
In the arms of a centerfold
Making love at night
Our new habitual
Feeling your heart 'til the daylight comes

Touching each other in these covers isn't saving lives
It's simply desire
But the warmth of you baby is saving mine
You set me on fire
Hold me close as I burn in your atmosphere
Girl you know I'll tear the sunshine down just to keep you here
Don't go this time
Stay for another night

I'll fight the day for you
In a daze for you
Everything side view
Nothing that tastes like you
With a gaze like you
Cut me straight, right through
Girl you give me something to prove in the dead of night
Girl you meet me afternoon and we'll do it right
Nocturnal sharing the light

I sit and wait for the street lights to wake
With a high beam flash and a red light brake
Burning the midnight gas off to somewhere safe
Laying next to you on the cityscape
